<h2><a name="IMPORTANT" id="IMPORTANT">IMPORTANT</a></h2>

<hr class="r5" />

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Reader</span>:</p>

<p>While an artist has been engaged
at a great expense to illustrate this volume
of funniness, I want it distinctly understood
that the illustrations are purely
ornamental and are not intended to be
diagrams of or keys to the jokes.</p>

<p>Between you and me, any one of
the jokes&mdash;if you like it&mdash;is worth eleven
times the price asked for the book. But,
like the filigree work on a lemon merangue
pie, the decoration may not make the pie
any more palatable&mdash;but, it looks a whole
lot better.</p>

<p class="sig">
Confidentially yours,
</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">
<a href="images/i004large.jpg"><img src="images/i004.jpg" width="200" height="450" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Ha! Ha! Ha! I am
astonished. I didn't
expect to find more
than ten persons in the
house to-night, and I see
there are eleven.</p>

<p>I want to thank that gentleman
in the first row&mdash;the
man with the vigorous growth
of hair. It's such a relief to
see a man with some hair, in
the front row.</p>

<p>Say, I don't think I ever
told you of the time I went
with a Shakespearian company
to tour the New England States.</p>

<p>Never knew I was an actor? Why, of course.</p>

<p>Wouldn't have thought it? Neither would I, if I
didn't know to what extremes a man of my attainments
may be driven, when his bread-basket is
empty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, I signed for a hundred a week and all expenses.</p>

<p>I got expenses all right, part of the time, and had
to employ one of Pinkerton's
men to look after
the salary.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 382px;">
<a href="images/i005large.jpg"><img src="images/i005.jpg" width="382" height="452" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Up to yesterday, he
hadn't found it; but no
actor who goes out of
New York town ever
expects to get any salary,
and I didn't.</p>

<p>I played Hamlet, Egglet,
Eyelet, Omelet and To Let.</p>

<p>Every time I played Hamlet, I got an Egglet in
the Eyelet, and I saved them up and made an Omelet,
which caused such a disturbance among the other
boarders, that my landlady told me my room was
To Let.</p>

<p>I was in hard luck all around.</p>

<p>The worst blow that ever struck yours truly, was
when we hit a little town in Maine called Haystack
Mountain.</p>

<p>People there didn't appreciate good acting and the
show went busted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, the manager had
an urgent engagement
with a sick friend in New
York, and he left us high
and dry.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 354px;">
<a href="images/i006large.jpg"><img src="images/i006.jpg" width="354" height="325" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Some of the girls wept
a little and asked how far
it was to the railroad station.</p>

<p>I didn't ask how far it was to the station. I knew
what to do. I began to walk.</p>

<p>Do you know, I never struck such a confounded
lot of ties in all my life.</p>

<p>The railroad must have employed non-union help.
You couldn't judge them at all. You'd strike a lot
that were three feet apart and think they were all
that way. You'd go to sleep until you struck one
at a four-foot interval; then you'd wake up pretty
quick and murmur gentle nothings about the company.</p>

<p>About the second day out, I landed at the town
of Bridgewater. I walked into the only hotel of the
place and thought I'd bluff 'em a little.</p>

<p>"What are the rates?" says I.</p>

<p>"Five dollars a day and up," says the clerk.</p>

<p>"Oh, come off," says I, "I'm an actor."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>"In that case," says he, "it's five dollars a day,
down."</p>

<p>Toward evening, I came to a siding where a lot of
box-cars were stalled. I crept on one of the trucks
and went to sleep. I woke up to find I was traveling
at the rate of forty miles an hour.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 362px;">
<a href="images/i007large.jpg"><img src="images/i007.jpg" width="362" height="307" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Suddenly I became
aware that I had a visitor,
and I knew my visitor
had visitors, too&mdash;because
I could hear him
scratching.</p>

<p>"Say," says I, "who the
dickens are you and what do you want?"</p>

<p>"Look here, young feller," says the visitor, "I'm
Cornelius Vanderbilt out for a spin in my new
automobile, and I won't be disturbed by the likes
of you."</p>

<p>"Where do you come from?" says I.</p>

<p>"Maryland," says he. "My father is a great farmer
down there. He raised a cabbage last year that
weighed four hundred pounds. Now, who are you?"</p>

<p>"Why," says I, "I'm Admiral Dewey on a tour of
inspection in my private car. I'm going back to
Brooklyn Navy Yard to superintend the manufacture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
of a boiler, so large that it takes two hundred and
fifty men to drive one of the rivets."</p>

<p>"Go slow, there," says he.
"What could they do with a
boiler so large as that?"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 379px;">
<a href="images/i008large.jpg"><img src="images/i008.jpg" width="379" height="334" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Why," says I, "they're
going to boil that cabbage
your father raised."</p>

<p>After a little while he
told me his name was Percival Reginald Van Dusenberry.
He was an actor, but he had been walking
longer than I.</p>

<p>When we struck the town of Grafton, we got off
our Pullman, and began looking for the graft.</p>

<p>Percy went up to a cottage and rapped at the
door, intending to ask for some cold victuals.</p>

<p>A hand shoved out and gave him a roll of green-backs.
Percy was dumfounded, but took to his
heels.</p>

<p>When we were about two miles away, Percy
looked at me, and said:</p>

<p>"Those lobsters took me for the landlord."</p>

<p>We located a restaurant presently, and sat waiting
at a table for an hour and a half.</p>

<p>Finally, Percy said to the fellow behind the desk:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you the proprietor of this hash house?"</p>

<p>"Yes," says he.</p>

<p>"Well, then I want to know if you sent your
waiter away, when you saw us coming, so you could
charge us for a night's lodging."</p>

<p>Just then the waiter came in.</p>

<p>"Say," says I, "do you know we have been waiting
here for an hour and a half?"</p>

<p>"That's nothing," says he, "I've been waiting here
for ten years."</p>

<p>He placed a carafe of
water on the table.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 318px;">
<a href="images/i009large.jpg"><img src="images/i009.jpg" width="318" height="418" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Look here," says Percy,
"I never drink water unless
it's absolutely pure and
healthy. Is this all right?"</p>

<p>"Sure," says the waiter.</p>

<p>Percy took a glassful, and most of
it was pollywogs.</p>

<p>"Look here," says he, "I thought you said this
water was healthy. Look at those bugs."</p>

<p>"That only proves what I said," says the waiter.
"If it wasn't healthy the bugs couldn't live in it."</p>

<p>Just then Percy's eye caught a sign that read:</p>

<p>"All the pancakes you can eat for ten cents."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm going to have some pancakes," says he.
"What's yours?"</p>

<p>"Chicken," says I.</p>

<p>Percy kept eating pancakes.</p>

<p>When he had eaten twenty
plates the boss of the joint
began to get interested.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 338px;">
<a href="images/i010large.jpg"><img src="images/i010.jpg" width="338" height="427" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Percy was certainly getting
the biggest ten cents'
worth I ever saw, when he
stepped over and says:</p>

<p>"Don't you think you
have had enough?"</p>

<p>"Just one more plate and then&mdash;" says Percy.</p>

<p>"Then what?" says the boss.</p>

<p>"Then you can tell the cook to make them a little
bit thicker," says Percy.</p>

<p>I tried to chew my chicken, but couldn't get it
down. I managed to catch the waiter on his fifteenth
lap between the kitchen and Percy's plate,
and says:</p>

<p>"Waiter, this chicken is awfully tough."</p>

<p>"Have some pancakes, then," says Percy. "They're
good and come cheap."</p>

<p>"Well," says the waiter, "that chicken always was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
a Jonah. When we tried to kill it, the darned thing
flew to the top of the house and we had to shoot it."</p>

<p>"Oh, that accounts for it," says I. "Your aim was
bad and you shot the weather cock by mistake."</p>

<p>Percy finally got enough pancakes and paid his
ten cents like a man.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 269px;">
<a href="images/i011large.jpg"><img src="images/i011.jpg" width="269" height="447" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>We traveled along the road
that leads from the hash house,
and met a farmer with a gun.</p>

<p>"Say," says I, "have you seen
anything worth shooting around
here?"</p>

<p>"Not until you came," says he.</p>

<p>I don't blame him though.</p>

<p>Talking of shooting, I don't
think I ever told you of the
time I went shooting with Teddy.</p>

<p>Teddy is a great shot, but he can't compare with
me. I'm going to sing you a song about it, entitled:</p>

<p>"Snap Shot, Half Shot, All Shot; or, It Costs
Money To Get Loaded."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">On the farms there's consternation,<br /></span>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 259px;">
<a href="images/i013large.jpg"><img src="images/i013.jpg" width="259" height="298" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>That's a very fine song, I'll
admit. Percy is just dead in love with it. He makes
me sing it about ten times a day.</p>

<p>He says he can sympathize with the horses and
cows, for he has "stopped many a charge that went
astray" and knows how it feels.</p>

<p>We left the farmer with the gun, and Percy began
to get woefully dry.</p>

<p>"Great Scott," says he, "I'd give almost anything
for a drink of whiskey."</p>

<p>He spied an old gent with a
kind face, tottering along the
road.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 260px;">
<a href="images/i014large.jpg"><img src="images/i014.jpg" width="260" height="273" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Just wait a minute," says
Percy, "I'll see if that old gent
carries a pocket flask."</p>

<p>So he went over and says:</p>

<p>"Kind sir, can you give a poor man who has heart
trouble a drop of whiskey?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>"You should not drink that stuff," says the old
man, "why do you do it?"</p>

<p>"Because I'm thirsty," says Percy.</p>

<p>"Then why don't you drink milk?" says he. "Milk,
you know, makes blood."</p>

<p>"But," says Percy, "I'm not blood-thirsty."</p>

<p>"The doctors," continued the old man, "say that
whiskey ruins the coat of the stomach. What would
you do if that happened in your case?"</p>

<p>"I'd mighty soon make the darn thing work in its
shirt-sleeves," says Percy.</p>

<p>We walked on and saw a farmhouse through the
trees.</p>

<p>Percy went up to ask for some cold victuals and
actually got the cold shoulder.</p>

<p>Then we struck the town of Freysburg. There's
where poor Percy got fried to
a rich, golden brown.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 292px;">
<a href="images/i015large.jpg"><img src="images/i015.jpg" width="292" height="379" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>It happened this way.</p>

<p>We saw a large tent in which
a revival meeting was going on.</p>

<p>"I'm going to take part,"
says Percy.</p>

<p>I tried to dissuade him, but
it wouldn't go.</p>

<p>The deacon looked him over and says:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>"Will the brother relate his experiences?"</p>

<p>I judged that Percy would have a very large contract
on his hands, but he went at it like a man.</p>

<p>Everybody was shouting something, so every time
Percy said anything, I shouted:</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven for that."</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen," says he, "I've been a villain
of the deepest dye."</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven for that," says I.</p>

<p>Percy looked at me and continued:</p>

<p>"Often I have felt tempted to commit suicide."</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven for that," says I.</p>

<p>"I'm heart and soul in the noble cause, but I'm
penniless."</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven for that," says I.</p>

<p>Percy went on:</p>

<p>"I know that these noble men and women will raise
a subscription to enable me to carry out my aims."</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven for that," says I.</p>

<p>Say, the way Percy got money
surprised me.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 325px;">
<a href="images/i016large.jpg"><img src="images/i016.jpg" width="325" height="312" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Finally, we got clear of the
tent and just sloped for it.</p>

<p>The next town a constable
was waiting for us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>He spotted Percy right away.</p>

<p>"You're wanted for obtaining money under false
pretenses," says he.</p>

<p>He took Percy to the court, which was held in the
rear of a grocery store.</p>

<p>Going in, I knocked a big cheese off the counter
and stooped to pick it up.</p>

<p>"That's all right," says the grocer, "it knows its
own way around the counter by this time."</p>

<p>The judge asked Percy what his profession was.</p>

<p>"I'm an actor," says Percy. "When I'm on the
stage I become so absorbed in my part that the
theatre vanishes, the audience disappears&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," commented the judge, "they go out and ask
for their money back. What were you before you
became a loafer?" asked the judge.</p>

<p>"I was a gentleman," says Percy.</p>

<p>"That's a good business, but you're not the only
one who failed in it," says the judge. "Now what
have you to say in your defense?"</p>

<p>"I must wait till my lawyer arrives," says he.</p>

<p>"Why," says the judge, "you were caught red-handed
with the goods on. What could your lawyer
say that would influence my decision?"</p>

<p>"That's just what I want to find out," says Percy.
"But give me a little time and I will explain all."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right," says the judge. "Six years at hard
labor. I hope you will be able to explain when you
get out, or back you'll go for another six."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 298px;">
<a href="images/i017large.jpg"><img src="images/i017.jpg" width="298" height="282" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>I was so afraid that the
judge would give me time to
explain why I was with Percy
that I started to run and didn't
stop until I got to Boston.</p>

<p>Now I'm going to sing you a
little song, entitled: "He Made a Foolish Break
And Got The Laugh; or, Wedded Persons' Compliments."</p>

<p>There! I'm greatly relieved now
that I've got that song off my mind. I was afraid
I might break down, because it's so touching.</p>

<p>Talking of relief, puts me in mind of a friend of
mine who wanted to be relieved, in the worst way,
of a barrel of over-ripe sauerkraut. When I heard
his tale of woe, I laughed so that I had to go and
buy a new pair of suspenders.</p>

<p>You see, he had a German friend who had the
kraut and didn't know what to do with it, so he
offered to send it home to
my friend Jenkins. Jenkins
accepted and stored it in
his cellar.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 345px;">
<a href="images/i019large.jpg"><img src="images/i019.jpg" width="345" height="377" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>The next day, the fellow
upstairs, named McCarthy,
came down and raised
thunder with his wife. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
Jenkins came home he heard all about it. He went
upstairs and saw the offender.</p>

<p>"Say," says he, "I understand you object to the
smell down in my cellar."</p>

<p>"No," says McCarthy, "I don't object to it down
there, but when it opens the cellar door and creeps
upstairs I do object. It kept me awake all last
night."</p>

<p>"Well," said Jenkins, "I'll put it out in
the yard behind the dog house."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 334px;">
<a href="images/i020large.jpg"><img src="images/i020.jpg" width="334" height="337" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>And he did.</p>

<p>The next morning he
went out to feed the dog
and found him&mdash;dead.</p>

<p>That day nine families
moved out of Jenkins' flat,
and the tenth was just going when he donated the
kraut to an orphan asylum. The orphans broke loose
and took leg bail.</p>

<p>There wasn't any one but the janitor to feed it to
and he threatened to quit.</p>

<p>The last Jenkins heard of the kraut, it was about
to be shipped to Dick Croker to sod his lawn at
Wantage.</p>

<p>I came near being put under the sod myself the
other day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>I heard that one of my best and oldest friends,
J. Fishpond O'Morgan, was down with rheumatism in
his arm, so I went around to see him.</p>

<p>As soon as I showed my face in the door, Fishpond
howled:</p>

<p>"I'm saved."</p>

<p>I did not know what he was driving at, so I said:</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>"I want you to do me a favor," says he. "Go
around to Prof. Sockem's and tell him to give
you some of the usual medicine."</p>

<p>I went to old Sockem's, and just caught him in.</p>

<p>"Doctor," says I, "my friend O'Morgan sent me
around for some of the usual for gout."</p>

<p>"All right," says he. "Arm, I suppose. Just roll
up your sleeve."</p>

<p>I thought I had struck a
maniac, so I tried to humor
him.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 315px;">
<a href="images/i021large.jpg"><img src="images/i021.jpg" width="315" height="383" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>He came back with a
suspicious-looking black bottle
and I thought I was a
gone goose sure. You see,
I had heard so much about
the black bottle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>He grabbed my wrist in a grip of iron, poured some
of the black bottle stuff on my arm and began to
rub it, gently.</p>

<p>Then he began to rub harder and faster, and I
could see my arm swell up like a pillow under the
fearful treatment.</p>

<p>I kicked, and finally managed to break loose.</p>

<p>"You confounded scoundrel," I says, "what do you
mean by assulting me?"</p>

<p>"Assulting you?" says he; "you wanted some of the
usual and you got it good and hard, but let me sell
you some of my medicine for swollen arms. It's the
best thing in the world for such cases."</p>

<p>Did you ever notice what a lot of trouble a simple,
little girl may make? Oh! you girls. You're never
happy unless you're making
some poor lobster show
how much money he has,
by blowing it in on you.</p>

<a href="images/i022large.jpg"><img src="images/i022.jpg" width="341" height="458" alt="" /></a>

<p>You know, though, girls,
I appreciate you, if no one
else does.</p>

<p>If it weren't for you, I'll
bet a dollar to Rockfeller's
oil-can that none of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
young fellows I see here to-night would have ever
thought of coming here.</p>

<p>Now I'm going to sing you a little warble entitled:</p>

<p>Did you hear that peculiar toot the fellow with
the big horn gave when I finished up?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>That means "Rotten" in his low vocabulary. He's
got a grudge against me.</p>

<p>Once, when he didn't occupy his present high
position, he came to me and wanted me to stake
him the price of the horn he just insulted me with.</p>

<p>"What!" says I. "Are you going to learn to be a
blower? Don't you think you are nuisance enough
already?"</p>

<p>You see, I wanted to save the money. He stood
firm though, and I had to cough up.</p>

<p>About a week later he came
around looking a perfect wreck.
His eye was closed, his head
bandaged, and his clothes in
shreds.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 281px;">
<a href="images/i026large.jpg"><img src="images/i026.jpg" width="281" height="522" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"What's the matter?" says I.
"Couldn't you manage the horn."</p>

<p>"Well, you see, Brother
Jones," says he, "I could manage
the horn all right, but I
could not manage the neighbors."</p>

<p>This same fellow is a bird fancier. He breeds all
kinds of birds.</p>

<p>I asked him to blow me to a small hot bird and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
a cold bottle now that he was so wealthy, and the
stare he gave me was so cold that it froze the highball
I carry in my pocket flask.</p>

<p>I don't care, though, if I didn't have the hot bird I
had a cold bottle.</p>

<p>He has a great flock of homing pigeons.</p>

<p>The other day he bet a fellow named Robinson,
that he could select two out of the bunch that
would come home no matter where they were taken.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 271px;">
<a href="images/i027large.jpg"><img src="images/i027.jpg" width="271" height="397" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Robinson thought a while, and
then said he'd bet they couldn't
come home from Coney Island.
I held the stakes.</p>

<p>When the birds were selected
and put in the basket, Robinson
slyly clipped their wings.</p>

<p>The next day the fellow came
to me and claimed the bet.</p>

<p>"What!" says I. "Did those birds come home?"</p>

<p>"Sure," says he. "But their feet are awfully sore."</p>

<p>Say, the other night I was coming down from
Yonkers in a trolley car.</p>

<p>No, I wasn't loaded. Do you think every fellow
who goes to Yonkers, has to get loaded to drown
his sorrow? No, I was quite sober.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>One fellow got up in a hurry to leave and brought
up plump against a stunning Fire-Island Cinnamon-Bear
blond, on the platform.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 319px;">
<a href="images/i028large.jpg"><img src="images/i028.jpg" width="319" height="422" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"It's a wonder you
wouldn't be careful," says
she of the red cranium.</p>

<p>"I am," says he, "but I
was dazzled by your head-light."</p>

<p>The ruddy complexioned
damsel came in and sat beside
me.</p>

<p>In the natural course of events we got to talking
and swapped childhood memories.</p>

<p>She told me that she was married, but didn't live
with her husband.</p>

<p>"In that case," says I, "you must be a grass
widow."</p>

<p>"Why, yes," she assented. "By the way, are you
a lawn mower?"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 261px;">
<a href="images/i029large.jpg"><img src="images/i029.jpg" width="261" height="274" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>I hastened to assure her that
I was a married man.</p>

<p>"Do you know," she says, as
we were crossing the Harlem
River, "I was walking over this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
bridge one time and suddenly a man ran up, seized
me, and before I could cry out, hurled me over the
rail."</p>

<p>"Can you swim?" says I.</p>

<p>"No," says she.</p>

<p>"Then how were you saved?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see, I walked ashore."</p>

<p>"Walked ashore," says I. "How could you walk
ashore?"</p>

<p>"Well, I had rubber boots on."</p>

<p>I thought that was pretty hard on the Harlem.</p>

<p>Say, that reminds me of a friend of mine who is
the most spiteful cuss alive.</p>

<p>The other day he went to visit his uncle whose
name is John Smith. He hadn't been to see him in
so long that he mistook the house, went up the
stoop of the house next door, and rang the bell.</p>

<p>A maid came to the door, evidently very much
out of humor.</p>

<p>"Is this John Smith's house?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, it ain't," she snapped, and slammed the door
in his face.</p>

<p>Smith walked the distance of several doors, then
went back and rang the same bell.</p>

<p>The identical girl came to the door, and Smith up
and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who the devil said it was John Smith's?" and
walked away.</p>

<p>Smith has a wife who is dead stuck on fortune
tellers and palmists.</p>

<p>The other day she called upon an East Indian
Prince on Thompson Street and had her fortune
told.</p>

<p>Among other things, he told her that she would
have visitors soon who would come to stay. She
couldn't think who it could be.</p>

<p>One night Smith came home, and his wife rushed
up to him and cried:</p>

<p>"Now, don't say again
there is nothing in fortune
telling. He told me that we
would have visitors who'd
come to stay, and we have.
Our cat has just had kittens."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 318px;">
<a href="images/i030large.jpg"><img src="images/i030.jpg" width="318" height="369" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Another time she went to
a palmist, who rambled on
telling her the usual stuff they tell every one.</p>

<p>Finally, she says:</p>

<p>"There is a line on your hand that indicates you
are a very beautiful woman."</p>

<p>"Does my hand tell that?" says Smith's wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sure," says the palmist.
"You don't suppose I could
tell that by looking at your
face, do you?"</p>

<p>Yeow&mdash;by James, I
thought I heard a cat that
time.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 343px;">
<a href="images/i031large.jpg"><img src="images/i031.jpg" width="343" height="402" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Say, I had an accident
with a cat the other night,
and I'm nervous for fear the S. P. C. A. will get
after me.</p>

<p>You see I came home pretty early and, just as I
got my key in the door, I heard something behind me.</p>

<p>I didn't pay any attention,
and as I opened the door that
something scooted past me and
slipped upstairs.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 271px;">
<a href="images/i032large.jpg"><img src="images/i032.jpg" width="271" height="320" alt="" /></a>

<p>I took off my boot, got a
light, and&mdash;the rest I'll tell you
in my latest sonata, entitled:</p>

<p>"Oh, Bring Back My Tabby To Me."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Not a mew was heard, not a feline note,<br /></span>

<p>That's a pretty good song, if I do say so myself.
I always feel like laughing when I sing it, though. It
reminds me of my dear departed friend, Tom
O'Moore.</p>

<p>This Tom was the brightest fellow that ever
lived.</p>

<p>One day he was greatly troubled with an aching
tooth. He went to the dentist and exhibited his
swollen jaw.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>"Which tooth do you want extracted?" asked the
dentist.</p>

<p>Tom pointed to a tooth opposite the swelling.</p>

<p>"Why," says the dentist, "the swelling is on the
other side."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 282px;">
<a href="images/i034large.jpg"><img src="images/i034.jpg" width="282" height="349" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Och," says Tom, "is it that
small lump you mane, that's
nothin'. That's only where
Bridget hit me with the lifter."</p>

<p>Tom had the troublesome
tooth taken out and left the
place.</p>

<p>Outside, he met his dear
friend O'Holleran who, as he saw Tom, yelled:</p>

<p>"I say, Tom, did you hear of the frightful miscarriage
of justice that McCarthy was the victim of?"</p>

<p>"No," says Tom, "what was it?"</p>

<p>"Well," says O'Holleran, "they locked poor Mac
up for being drunk when he was clane sober."</p>

<p>"Begob," says Tom, "I don't belave it at all, at all.
Mac must have been drunk to let them lock him up
when he was sober."</p>

<p>"I say, Tom," says O'Holleran, "do you believe in
drames?"</p>

<p>"Sure, I do," says Tom. "Whoi?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then what's it a sign of when a married man
drames he's a bachelor?"</p>

<p>"Begob," says Tom, "it's a sign of disappointment&mdash;when
he wakes up."</p>

<p>"Do you know, Tom," says O'Holleran, "I'd give a
hundred dollars to know the exact spot I'm going to
die on."</p>

<p>"Whoi?" says Tom.</p>

<p>"Whoi, you gossoon, I'd never go near the ould
spot at all, at all."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 292px;">
<a href="images/i035large.jpg"><img src="images/i035.jpg" width="292" height="363" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Tom and O'Holleran took a
walk through the suburbs, and
came upon some blackberry
bushes laden with half-ripe
fruit.</p>

<p>"I say," says O'Holleran,
"what kind of bushes do you
call those, Tom?"</p>

<p>"Whoi, you fule," says Tom, "they're blackberries."</p>

<p>"Get out," says O'Holleran, "they're red."</p>

<p>"Sure," says Tom, "but every fule knows that
blackberries are always red when they're green."</p>

<p>A little way beyond, they came to a crossroad.
Tom said they ought to go to the right and O'Holleran
said to the left.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>They argued for a while, and Tom says:</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what we'll do. You go by one and I'll
take the other. If I get home first, I'll put a chalk
mark on the door, and if you get there first you rub
it out."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 273px;">
<a href="images/i036large.jpg"><img src="images/i036.jpg" width="273" height="296" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Tom recently imported one of
his poor relatives to this country.
His name was Pat Sullivan.</p>

<p>Pat was a very thick Irishman,
and as he had never seen a
railroad in Erin-Go-Bra-a-a-a-ha,
he couldn't get it into his head how it worked.</p>

<p>Finally Tom took him up a railroad track to explain
the matter to him.</p>

<p>When they were rounding a curve, between two
high embankments, a train came thundering behind
them.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 321px;">
<a href="images/i037large.jpg"><img src="images/i037.jpg" width="321" height="406" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Run up the bank for your life,"
cried Tom, and set a good
example by doing it himself.</p>

<p>Pat, however, dug straight
down the track, and it was
not long before the train
overtook him and hurled him
forty feet away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ye lobster," says Tom, "whoi didn't you run up
the bank as I told you?"</p>

<p>"Begob," says Pat, "if I couldn't beat that bloomin'
thing on the level, what chance did I stand running
uphill?"</p>

<p>By the way, did you ever get into one of those lunch
counter, go-outside-and-get-something-fit-to-eat restaurants?
I did, and it's a regular circus. If you've
never been, you want to take it in.</p>

<p>The other day I had sixteen cents with which to
get something to eat, and I thought I'd chance it.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 359px;">
<a href="images/i038large.jpg"><img src="images/i038.jpg" width="359" height="274" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>I stepped into one of
these holy terrors and
sat down on a revolving
stool similar to those
they have in dry goods
stores.</p>

<p>These seats are placed so closely together that
your neighbor's business is your own.</p>

<p>You try to eat your soup. He nudges you and
sends it back in your plate.</p>

<p>He tries to eat his pork and beans. You nudge
him and he fishes in his vest pocket for pork, and
down his shirt front for beans.</p>

<p>Well, I picked up the bill of fare and glanced over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
it. Really, I hadn't been out late for a week and I
didn't know what to make of it.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 332px;">
<a href="images/i039large.jpg"><img src="images/i039.jpg" width="332" height="388" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>The first entree was:</p>

<p>"Omelette a la Creole."</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" I thought.
"Do they slice Creoles and
serve them as omelettes?"</p>

<p>I wasn't very anxious to find out.</p>

<p>The next was:</p>

<p>"Rice soup a la Bellevue."</p>

<p>"Holy smoke, I have the rum
habit so bad, I imagine I see Bellevue everywhere I
go. I wonder what would happen if I were to take
that?"</p>

<p>I got nervous and prepared to leave.</p>

<p>The last thing I saw on the calender was</p>

<p>"Croquettes a la D'Esprit."</p>

<p>"That's it exactly," I thought, "they get so desperate
in these places that they hash up all the leavings
and call them by their right name."</p>

<p>When I passed the manager of the shebang, he
says:</p>

<p>"What's the matter? Are you dissatisfied with
what you've had?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," says I, "it's what I haven't had
that I am dissatisfied with."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>When I got outside of the restaurant, who should
I run into but my dear friend, Rufus Sage.</p>

<p>"Hello, Rufus," says I, "how's business?"</p>

<p>"Candidly," says he, "it's rotten. I made only three
millions this morning, and I've got to get a new suit
this afternoon that will cost all the way from ten to
fifteen dollars."</p>

<p>"Too bad," says I.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 309px;">
<a href="images/i040large.jpg"><img src="images/i040.jpg" width="309" height="436" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Then, besides, I'm liable to
be inconvenienced any time,"
he says, "through an argument
I had with a friend of mine
this morning. He said I was
extravagant, and I said I
wasn't."</p>

<p>"Well," says I, "did you
succeed in getting him to think the same as
yourself?"</p>

<p>"Yes," says he, "but I may get arrested any
minute for assult and battery, and they'll fine me not
less than five dollars."</p>

<p>I don't think I ever told you of the awful time I
had, when I went yachting with my friend Rufus
Sage, did I?</p>

<p>Oh! It was a swell time, indeed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>It began to swell the minute we struck the swell
outside the harbor, and my poetic soul swelled up
within me in great shape.</p>

<p>I was leaning over the rail looking at the beautiful
green waves and the reflection of my beautiful face
in them (no, I wasn't doing anything else), when my
dear friend, Rufus, came to me and said:</p>

<p>"Cheer up, old man, things will get pleasanter,
when the moon comes up."</p>

<p>"Darnation," says I, "it has come up, if I ever
swallowed it."</p>

<p>Right after that, we encountered a most terrific
gale. The wind blew, the storm howled, the ship
tossed, and the lightning flashed. In fact, we were
in a devil of a mess all around.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 320px;">
<a href="images/i041large.jpg"><img src="images/i041.jpg" width="320" height="346" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>I found my ear in the
captain's mouth and he was
telling me something I didn't
want to know.</p>

<p>The captain found my
right boot exactly where it
should have been under the
circumstances.</p>

<p>The last thing I saw was Rufus running to his
cabin to get a two-for-five collar button he had left
in his trunk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>All hands got safely into the boat but me. There
was so much of me overboard already that I didn't
care how soon my skeleton followed.</p>

<p>Finally the ship sank and I found myself astride a
big hogshead. I was in an awful situation.</p>

<p>Suddenly, I sighted a flagstaff with a flag attached,
and within an hour was in grabbing distance.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 290px;">
<a href="images/i042large.jpg"><img src="images/i042.jpg" width="290" height="356" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"This," I says, "is all right.
I'll put the staff in the bung-hole
of the barrel and fly a
signal of distress."</p>

<p>It flew fine, until a gust of
wind took it away. But, as
you know, I am a man of resource.</p>

<p>I took off my jacket and hoisted it in the place of
the flag.</p>

<p>Another gust of wind came and blew my jacket
away. Then I hoisted my shirt. That blew away
and I hoisted my socks. Those followed, and I
hoisted my trousers.</p>

<p>Say, but it was good I had that barrel. Those
pajamas saved my life, though. A week later a
passing steamer caught sight of my signal of distress
and rescued me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>The first thing I asked the captain was if Rufus
had been saved.</p>

<p>"Why," says he, "haven't you heard? He landed
at Savannah and cornered the cotton market to the
tune of ten million dollars, but he says he's a ruined
man because he lost his yacht."</p>

<p>Say, how do you stand on the servant question?
I had a girl that beat all outdoors for intelligence.</p>

<p>The other day my wife went
out to do some shopping and
left Bridget in charge of the
house.</p>

<p>When she returned she asked
Bridget if any one had called
for her.</p>

<p>"Sure, mum," says she, "the
babbie called for you all the
while you were gone."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 278px;">
<a href="images/i043large.jpg"><img src="images/i043.jpg" width="278" height="445" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>That night, when I came home to dinner, I couldn't
eat a thing. Everything that wasn't glowing embers,
was charcoal. I gave my wife a lecture and told
her to fire the girl at once.</p>

<p>My wife went down to Bridget's stronghold and
said:</p>

<p>"Bridget, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you'll have to
find another place."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>"Whoy so, mum?" asked Bridget.</p>

<p>"Well, my husband thinks there's too much waste
in the kitchen."</p>

<p>"For the land's sakes, if you'll only let me stay,
mum, I'll get a twenty-two corset and lace it until I
can't breathe."</p>

<p>One day a friend of mine came to me and says:</p>

<p>"I see you have Bridget Harrohan around the
house."</p>

<p>"Yes," says I.</p>

<p>"Do you know that she was
in her last situation five years."</p>

<p>"No," says I; "where was
that?"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 285px;">
<a href="images/i044large.jpg"><img src="images/i044.jpg" width="285" height="302" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Sing Sing," says he.</p>

<p>I went home and sent Bridget
away.</p>

<p>My wife, in sympathy, recommended her to one of
her dearest friends. That sympathy was beautiful
to see.</p>

<p>A little later Bridget came back and announced
that the friend had engaged her.</p>

<p>"So the lady engaged you, at once, when you told
her you had been with me," says she.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" says Bridget. "She said any one who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
could stay with you three months, must be an
angel."</p>

<p>Say, I picked up a newspaper this morning, and I
was astonished at the great events that are taking
place.</p>

<p>I see that George Washington, colored, was appointed
postmaster of the town of Gooseberry, N. C.,
at 9:15 yesterday morning, took up his situation at
9:30, and was lynched at 9:45.</p>

<p>I see that Mark Hanna has donated two millions
to be spent in buying ice-cream and ginger snaps for
the w-o-r-k-i-n-g-m-a-n.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 275px;">
<a href="images/i045large.jpg"><img src="images/i045.jpg" width="275" height="321" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>I had a terrible dream about
Mark, last night. It was so
terrible that I got right up and
dedicated a song to it.</p>

<p>It's entitled:</p>

<p>"What Did I Have For Supper;
or, If I Knew What It
Was I'd Eat It Again."</p>

<p>A low key, professor. Not a latchkey.</p>

</div>

<p>Verily, verily, Republics and friends are ungrateful.</p>

<p>Do you know, all the gentlemen I mentioned in
that song I just sang are my friends?</p>

<p>Talking of friends, puts me in mind of an ungrateful
cuss I once called by this over-worked figure of
speech.</p>

<p>He met me on the street, slapped me on the back,
and said:</p>

<p>"Hello, old man!"</p>

<p>"Hello!" says I, "what do you want?"</p>

<p>"What do I want?" says he. "I want ten dollars."</p>

<p>"That's an awful large sum of money, and I'm
afraid I haven't got it to lend," says I.</p>

<p>"You've got it in the bank?" says he.</p>

<p>"Yes," says I.</p>

<p>"Now, look here," says he. "The Good Book
teaches us that we are all brothers."</p>

<p>"Granted," says I.</p>

<p>"Well," says he, "if I am your brother, by moral
right what's yours is mine, and what's mine is yours.
If I had the money I'd give it to you so quick it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
would take your breath away. Now, what you ought
to do is to draw that money from the bank."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 280px;">
<a href="images/i048large.jpg"><img src="images/i048.jpg" width="280" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>I rushed down to the bank, and says to the teller:</p>

<p>"Is the cashier in?"</p>

<p>"No," says he, "he's out. Are you
a depositor?"</p>

<p>"Yes," says I.</p>

<p>"Then you're out, too; the
police are on the trail now."</p>

<p>I went back to Harris, and
gave him the last cent I had.
He promised to pay me back in an
hour.</p>

<p>A month after I met him.</p>

<p>"Say," says I, "how about that money I lent you?
You said you only wanted it for a short time."</p>

<p>"That's right," says he, "I only had it for ten minutes.
I went into a faro game."</p>

<p>Some time ago, Harris visited a tailor and had an
overcoat made. He wanted trust, and the tailor,
of course, wanted references.</p>

<p>Harris put up such a bluff that the tailor gave
him the overcoat. He certainly played his game to
perfection.</p>

<p>Then Harris wouldn't pay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>The tailor came around and said:</p>

<p>"See here, Harris, wasn't I kind enough to let you
have that coat on tick? And now you won't pay.
I'm sure it was the best that I could make, and it
must have worn well."</p>

<p>"Certainly," says Harris, "all my nephews wore it."</p>

<p>"There, didn't I tell you it&mdash;" began the tailor.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Harris, "every time it got wet it shrunk
so that the next youngest one could wear it."</p>

<p>Then the fun began.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 317px;">
<a href="images/i049large.jpg"><img src="images/i049.jpg" width="317" height="426" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>The tailor put the bill into
a collector's hands.</p>

<p>The collector called upon
Harris.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry for you, old
man," said the collector, "but
your tailor has put your account
into my hands for collection."</p>

<p>"Indeed, I'm so sorry for you. And you say you're
going to try to collect it eh?" says Harris. "Well,
I am so sorry for you."</p>

<p>The collector couldn't get a cent. Every time he
called after that, Harris threw him downstairs.</p>

<p>Why, he got so after a while, that as soon as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
Harris appeared at the door, he would rush to the
stairs and throw himself down.</p>

<p>Harris had him trained.</p>

<p>The tailor hit upon a brilliant scheme.</p>

<p>He hired a woman to collect the bill.</p>

<p>Harris was in a dilemma. He couldn't throw a
woman downstairs.</p>

<p>He told me about it, and asked my advice, but I
had none to give.</p>

<p>The next time I met him he shook me by the hand
and said:</p>

<p>"I got around that woman-collector business all
right. She never went back to the bloomin' tailor
after the second time she called."</p>

<p>"Why," says I, "how did you manage it?"</p>

<p>"Oh!" says he, "that was dead easy. I just married
her."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 274px;">
<a href="images/i050large.jpg"><img src="images/i050.jpg" width="274" height="418" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Did you ever strike one of those people
who are dead stuck on their lineage
and have charts tacked on
their bedroom door, showing how
many thousand years they can
trace their ancestors?</p>

<p>I struck a "she" specimen the
other day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 280px;">
<a href="images/i051large.jpg"><img src="images/i051.jpg" width="280" height="332" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>As soon as we were introduced,
she says: "Jones, Jones,
surely you are a descendant of the
famous family of Joneses, who
had their origin in the stone age
and lived in a cave on the Palisades,
about a mile from
Hoboken?"</p>

<p>"I can't remember," says I, "it's so long ago and I
have a poor memory."</p>

<p>"Yes, but let us come nearer to the present generation,"
says she. "You surely are a relative of the
Joneses, the Milwaukee millionaires of the same
name."</p>

<p>"Yes," I says, "a distant relative."</p>

<p>"How distant?" she says.</p>

<p>"As distant as they can keep me," says I.</p>

<p>"Have you any poor relatives?" says she.</p>

<p>"None that know me," says I.</p>

<p>That got her mad. She says:</p>

<p>"If I were your wife, I would put poison in your
coffee."</p>

<p>"And if I was your husband," says I, "I'd drink it."</p>

<p>The other day I met Charlie de Hopen Dagen,
the Scotchman, who had just enlisted for service in
the Philippines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hello, old man!" says he, "come and have a
drink."</p>

<p>I wasn't feeling very thirsty, but I went.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that I had about ten thousand
Manhattans, and then we had nine thousand and
forty-eight whiskey sours to counterbalance them
and try to sober up.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 273px;">
<a href="images/i052large.jpg"><img src="images/i052.jpg" width="273" height="259" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Something made Charlie rampageous,
and he began to scrap
with the barkeeper and almost
killed him.</p>

<p>I finally got Charlie, seeing
four moons and ten gangplanks,
on board his vessel which was just about to leave.</p>

<p>The next day I met his brother Jim.</p>

<p>"Hello, Walter, I hear you saw Charlie off last
night," says he.</p>

<p>"Yes," says I, "he was very much off."</p>

<p>"Was he in good spirits when you left him?" says he.</p>

<p>"Sure," says I, "the best that money could buy.
He was a little sick, though."</p>

<p>"I hope it wasn't anything contagious," says he.</p>

<p>"If you could see the barkeeper up in Dan Mulligan's
place," says I, "you'd thought it was."</p>

<p>Say, every one says Lakewood is so healthy,
know why?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>I heard only the other day, from a man who knew
all about it.</p>

<p>I went down there, and the first thing I struck
was one of those watering carts, plastered over with
a patent medicine ad.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 326px;">
<a href="images/i053large.jpg"><img src="images/i053.jpg" width="326" height="294" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Holy smoke!" says a
fellow who stood beside
me on the station. "No
wonder Lakewood is so
healthy. They water the
streets with Fakir's Sarsaparilla."</p>

<p>Did you ever notice that when you have been
taking liquid refreshments and are feeling good, and
can't walk straight, then is the time you meet all your
dearly beloved friends who like to talk about you?</p>

<p>The other night I went to a beer party, and when
it got time to go home, I felt pretty much so-so.</p>

<p>I started out and the very first fellow I met was
Jenkins.</p>

<p>"Why, my dear Walter," says he, "I am surprised.
Don't give way to strong drink. Verily, verily, put it
behind you."</p>

<p>"Why, parson," says I, "I am very much surprised
that you can't see that I've got it behind me now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 259px;">
<a href="images/i054large.jpg"><img src="images/i054.jpg" width="259" height="394" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Say," says I, "I fell down
stairs last night, parson, with
twenty bottles of beer, and didn't
break one of them."</p>

<p>"Verily, verily," says he, "that
was indeed marvelous. How did
you accomplish that extraordinary
feat?"</p>

<p>"I had them inside me," says I.</p>

<p>The parson passed on and the next fellow I met
was Dr. Brown of Spotless Town.</p>

<p>"What!" says he, "drinking beer again, friend
Jones? I thought I told you that every glass of
beer you took put a nail in your coffin."</p>

<p>"Can't give it up, doctor," says I. "Then, too,
what does it matter after you're dead and gone if
your coffin is as full of nails as the new East
River Bridge is full of rivets."</p>

<p>I began to get a little confused, and couldn't see
very clearly.</p>

<p>I met a friend and says:</p>

<p>"Say, Tom, can you tell me what has become of
Walter Jones?"</p>

<p>"Why," says he, "you're Walter Jones yourself,
ain't you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know it," says I, "but I want to know where
he's got to."</p>

<p>He took me home.</p>

<p>The next morning my wife thought I was down-hearted.
So I was. She tried to cheer me up.</p>

<p>"Oh, Walter! look here, the morning paper says
that in Yumyami, Africa, a wife may be bought for
twenty yards of cotton cloth."</p>

<p>"Well," says I, "I guess a good wife is worth it."</p>

<p>Then she started on another tack.</p>

<p>"By the way, you know Charlie Benson, don't you?"</p>

<p>I admitted that I did.</p>

<p>"Well," says she, "of late he has become quite attentive.
I really think he means to run away with me."</p>

<p>"I'd like to see him do it," says I.</p>

<p>"Why," says she, "here's an account of a very intrepid
photographer, who took a picture of a wildcat,
just as it was about to spring at him."</p>

<p>"That's nothing," says I. "Jimmy Peck has a snap
shot of his wife coming
at him with a kettle of
boiling water."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 367px;">
<a href="images/i055large.jpg"><img src="images/i055.jpg" width="367" height="275" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"It says here that
lightning never strikes
twice in the same place.
I wonder why?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>"Any fool knows that," says I. "When the lightning
comes again the place isn't there to strike."</p>

<p>"Say," says she, "I heard that you spoke to that
ugly Mrs. De Fashion yesterday."</p>

<p>"Yes," I assented.</p>

<p>"She had a new hat on; did you notice what it
was like?" says she.</p>

<p>"Well," says I, "it had a cowcatcher front, a
battered-down funnel, a tailboard behind, a flower
garden on top, and a job lot of ribbons streaming
down in back. You can easily make one like it."</p>

<p>She soon got tired of trying to cheer me up and
quit in disgust. It's a pretty hard job to cheer me
up when I'm down-hearted.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 228px;">
<a href="images/i056large.jpg"><img src="images/i056.jpg" width="228" height="417" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Just then the bell rang, and the
maid announced the doctor. He
came in looking like a big sunflower.</p>

<p>"Sorry, old man, to see you in
such a condition last night," says he.</p>

<p>"Bad condition, doctor," says I.
"Why, that wasn't a flea bite to
the condition I'm in this morning."</p>

<p>"I called upon Rollins this morning,"
says he, "and I never saw a man in such a
complete state of mental depression. He says he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
was out with you last night. Can't you go around
and convince him that his life still holds some future
brightness for him?"</p>

<p>"Doctor," says I, "that's impossible. He's drawn
his salary three weeks in advance and spent it all
last night."</p>

<p>"Do you know," says the doctor, "I had a very remarkable
experience last night. A young fellow
came to me and said he had swallowed a cent and I
made him cough up two dollars."</p>

<p>That doctor has a son that
beats anything you ever heard
tell of. He has made all his
money on apples.</p>

<p>No, he don't grow them. He's
a doctor.</p>

<p>It's little green apples I'm talking about now.</p>

<p>When leaving, the doctor told me I must take to
automobiling and I would soon get well. I told my
wife about it.</p>

<p>"Doc is simple to throw money away like that,"
says she.</p>

<p>"Don't worry about that," says I. "He charges
double price for surgical visits."</p>

<p>"Well," says she, "with all his faults, Dr.
Brown has never had a patient die on his hands."</p>

<p>"Get out," says I, "is that
so?"</p>

<p>"Yes," says she. "When he
sees that they are doomed, he
sends them to a specialist.</p>

<p>"Oh, Walter!" says she. "By
the way, are we all out of debt?"</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven, we are," I replied.</p>

<p>"Then let's give a swell dinner."</p>

<p>"But that would throw us into debt again."</p>

<p>"Of course it would, but what is the use of having
good credit unless you can use it?"</p>

<p>I suppose after that I ought to sing you my latest
howling success, entitled "No New Proverbs for
Your Willie Boy; or, Some of the Fifty-seven."</p>

<p>Say, do you know I'm always
afraid to carry that song about
with me, for fear that some
burglar will follow me home and
steal it while I'm asleep.</p>

<p>The truth is I'm somewhat afraid of burglars.</p>

<p>The other night my wife woke me up and said:</p>

<p>"Walter, Walter, there are burglars in the house."</p>

<p>"All right, just take a light and turn them out,"
says I.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid they might run away with me," says she.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>"No fear of that if you take a light," says I. "By
the way, dear, do you knew that a Washington man
was shot by a burglar and his life was saved by a
pajama button, which the bullet struck?"</p>

<p>"Well, what of it?" says she.</p>

<p>"Nothing," says I, "except that the button must
have been on."</p>

<p>Well, she wailed and went on so bad, that I had
to go down and see what the racket was.</p>

<p>I went into the dining-room and there stood the
burglar.</p>

<p>"Hold up your hands," says he.</p>

<p>"I'm darned if I do," says I. "My wife rules me
by day, and you're not going to butt in and do it by
night."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 265px;">
<a href="images/i061large.jpg"><img src="images/i061.jpg" width="265" height="303" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>I grabbed a chair and went at
him.</p>

<p>We finally compromised.</p>

<p>He was to take everything of
any value if he would only let
me&mdash;I mean if I would only let him up.</p>

<p>He took all the silverware off the
sideboard and began to pack it up.</p>

<p>Just then my little Josephine called from the
cradle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>"Say," says my visitor, "I've spotted this house
for two weeks and didn't know you had a baby. If
you call that sharp-nosed woman, wifie, and that kid
yonder, baby, I guess you're blessed enough and in
need of sleep. Let's call it a draw. Thank Heaven
I ain't married."</p>

<p>"You'll be sorry you didn't get married, if you
don't," says I.</p>

<p>"That's all right," says he, "I'd a heap rather that
I wasn't, than be married and sorry that I was."</p>

<p>Well, after much mutual congratulation, the midnight
visitor finally took his leave.</p>

<p>I was about to go upstairs, when I heard talking
down in the basement.</p>

<p>I thought that perhaps there were a few more
poor devils down there who would sympathize with
me, and went down to make their acquaintance.</p>

<p>I was mistaken.</p>

<p>It was only my servant, Bridget, talking to a policeman
stationed on the beat.</p>

<p>I have a friend who had a very wild son about
sixteen years of age. He could do absolutely nothing
with him.</p>

<p>One day the youngster was offered a job in a big
tinware factory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>His father, thinking it might tone him down a bit,
consented to let him go.</p>

<p>The first Saturday night the kid lost his week's
wages in a crap game and was afraid to go home.</p>

<p>Finally he hit upon a bright scheme. He took his
trousers, turned them inside out and had them galvanized.</p>

<p>That night he went home and his father prepared
to give him a spanking.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 275px;">
<a href="images/i062large.jpg"><img src="images/i062.jpg" width="275" height="362" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>He used his hand first, but
the blow almost killed his father.</p>

<p>Then he used a club, but
failed to make any impression
upon his son.</p>

<p>Then he got out of patience
and said to his wife:</p>

<p>"Maria, confound it, get me a
can opener."</p>

<p>Now this same Billy got so educated in that factory,
that he wanted to go West and shoot millionaires,
so he just sloped.</p>

<p>His father telegraphed all over the country, and
then, as a last resort, rang up police headquarters.</p>

<p>"Well," says the chief, "it ought to be easy to find
him. Has he any marks by which he can be
identified?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>"N-o-o!" says the father. "But confound him, just
let me get a hold of him and he will have."</p>

<p>They finally located Willie comfortably settled on
a farm. There was a job open and he advised his
father to come out and take it, and make a few million
growing wheat for the food trust.</p>

<p>His father went and they got along swimmingly.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 281px;">
<a href="images/i063large.jpg"><img src="images/i063.jpg" width="281" height="339" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>One day a neighbor came
across Willie hustling like old
Sam Hill to reload a wagon of
hay which had overturned.</p>

<p>"Well, Willie, I see you are
in trouble."</p>

<p>"Yes," says Willie, working
for dear life.</p>

<p>"Suppose you come to the house and have dinner
with me," says the neighbor.</p>

<p>Willie wouldn't hear of it. The man finally persuaded
him to go.</p>

<p>All the way to the house and at dinner Willie
kept saying:</p>

<p>"I shouldn't have come. I know dad won't like it."</p>

<p>"Why," says the neighbor, "your father will never
know unless you tell him."</p>

<p>"I know, I know," says Willie, "but I'm sure father
won't like my going to dinner with you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>"Darnation," says the neighbor, now thoroughly
worked up. "Why won't he?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see," says Willie, "dad's under the load
of hay on the road."</p>

<p>Speaking of Willie puts me in mind of another boy
I know.</p>

<p>He's the brightest chap for his years to be found
in a day's walk.</p>

<p>Why, when the boy was six months old, he howled
all night and slept all day.</p>

<p>They fooled him though, by putting an electric light
in front of his parent's door, while he slept one day.</p>

<p>When he woke up to give his usual nightly concert,
he found the room as bright as day.</p>

<p>He just turned over and went to sleep again.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 265px;">
<a href="images/i064large.jpg"><img src="images/i064.jpg" width="265" height="340" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>That boy is a genius though, in his
way.</p>

<p>Why, do you know that they have
had thirty-four examinations since he's
been going to school, and he's managed
to dodge every one of them.</p>

<p>I went down to one of the
big department stores the other
day and met my old friend Matt Wheeler looking
over some furniture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 269px;">
<a href="images/i065large.jpg"><img src="images/i065.jpg" width="269" height="346" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Hello, Matt," says I, "how's
Mamie?" Mamie is his sweetheart,
you know.</p>

<p>"Oh!" says Matt, "I've thrown
her over."</p>

<p>"Well, that was a foolish thing
to do," says I. "Mamie was a
good and beautiful girl."</p>

<p>"I know it," says he, "but her father offered to
give us enough money to furnish a home, if we got
married. I'm going with another girl now."</p>

<p>"What sort of a girl is she," says I, and that
started him off.</p>

<p>Have you ever noticed how easy it is to start a
fellow extolling the virtues and graces of his chosen
before he is married?</p>

<p>If you ask him how his wife is after the ceremony,
all you get out of him is something resembling
a grunt.</p>

<p>Well, this fellow rambled.</p>

<p>"She's an angel. She isn't like other girls. She's
got the loveliest complexion. The handsomest face,
the finest figure, the sweetest nature that ever
woman had."</p>

<p>"Good," says I, "but how about her feet?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 277px;">
<a href="images/i066large.jpg"><img src="images/i066.jpg" width="277" height="383" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Feet, man," says he, "what
are you talking about? Are you
demented?"</p>

<p>"No," says I, "but you ought
to have looked at her feet."</p>

<p>"What has her feet got to do
with it?" says he, "I'm marrying
the girl, not her feet."</p>

<p>"That's right," says I, "but
you'll get her feet thrown into the bargain. Never
marry a club-footed girl, because she's always got
something to hit you with in case of an argument."</p>

<p>Even that didn't shut him up.</p>

<p>"Let me tell you how I got engaged to her,"
says he.</p>

<p>"Go ahead," says I.</p>

<p>"I was down to her house one night and stayed
until almost one o'clock.</p>

<p>"Finally her old man hollered downstairs and
asked the girl if I didn't think it was about time to
go to bed.</p>

<p>"I hollered up that it was all right, I'd excuse him
if he wanted to go.</p>

<p>"Then we got talking about birds, birdlets and
birdies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>"I said I loved birdies of all kinds.</p>

<p>"She tore over to the piano and began to play: 'I
Wish I Were a Birdie.' Yes, we're looking for a
nest now."</p>

<p>Now I'm going to sing you a song about this
foolish couple.</p>

<p>Just sit back and hold tight.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></div></div>

<p>That song always makes me sad.</p>

<p>It's founded upon one of my actual experiences.</p>

<p>I was a married man, once, though I may not
look it.</p>

<p>One night I came home late and knocked at the
door.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 275px;">
<a href="images/i068large.jpg"><img src="images/i068.jpg" width="275" height="373" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>My wife shoved her head
out of the window, and says:</p>

<p>"Is that you, Billy, dear?"</p>

<p>My name's not Billy. I got
divorced.</p>

<p>Talking of graveyards, I took
a trip to Philly last week.</p>

<p>Say, I never had such fun since I
sold my automobile.</p>

<p>The circus began at Hoboken and continued all
the way down.</p>

<p>When I got to the station I noticed an Irishman
sitting out of harm's way, holding his jaw.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, old man?" says I; "toothache?"</p>

<p>"Yes, bedad," says he, "but I'm going to get rid
of it."</p>

<p>He got a strong piece of twine, tied one end to
the offending molar, and the other to the rail of the
last car of the Washington express.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon the train started.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 256px;">
<a href="images/i069large.jpg"><img src="images/i069.jpg" width="256" height="285" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>The twine held and so did the
tooth.</p>

<p>You never saw any one run
to beat that fool Irishman. He
had Duffy beaten to death.</p>

<p>Finally after he had run a two-mile straight-away,
the cord snapped, but the tooth stayed in. Pat
came back.</p>

<p>"Be jabbers," says he, "the dum thing fooled me
that time, but I'll get even. I'll go to a dentist."</p>

<p>I got on my train and took a seat in the forward
car.</p>

<p>Just opposite, a very stylish, rather beautiful lady
sat next to a clerical-looking chap.</p>

<p>When the conductor came around for her ticket,
she fumbled for her purse, then grew pale and gasped:</p>

<p>"I've been robbed. There is nothing in my pocket
but a piece of orange peel, some cloves, and a bottle
of whiskey."</p>

<p>Then she began to throw the articles on the floor.</p>

<p>"Madam," said the deep bass voice of the clerical-looking
chap, "I'll thank you to take your hands out
of my pocket and leave its contents alone."</p>

<p>Then I began to look around for some other diversion,
and got it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>In front of me sat an old
gentleman with a man-servant
in attendance.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 267px;">
<a href="images/i070large.jpg"><img src="images/i070.jpg" width="267" height="341" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>He was greatly bothered by
a fly, which used to go in one
ear and out the other.</p>

<p>You know how they do,
sometimes.</p>

<p>The fly had made ten laps, and was comfortably
along on its eleventh, when the old fellow called
his servant.</p>

<p>"John," says he, quietly, "catch the little creature
as gently as possible and put it out of the window.
Don't hurt it, though, or I shall be angry."</p>

<p>John, who evidently knew his master's weakness,
caught the bothersome fly and carried it to an open
window.</p>

<p>"Ah, master," pleaded he, "just look, it is beginning
to rain. Shall I not give the poor little fly a mackintosh
and an umbrella?"</p>

<p>Just then the train stopped at a way station and
I got off to get a bite to eat. As usual, I got left.</p>

<p>While waiting, my attention was attracted to an
elderly couple, who had approached the ticket agent
as he came out of his coop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>"Say, boss," says the old man, "can you tell me if
the three-fifteen has left?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," says the agent, "it went by ten minutes
ago."</p>

<p>"And when will the four-thirty be along, do you
think?"</p>

<p>"Not for some time, of course," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Are there any expresses before then?"</p>

<p>"Not one."</p>

<p>"Any freight trains?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Nothing at all?"</p>

<p>"Nothing whatsoever."</p>

<p>"Are you quite sure?"</p>

<p>"Of course I am, or I wouldn't have said so,"
yelled the agent.</p>

<p>"Then, Maria," says the old man, "if we're quite
careful, I guess we can cross the tracks."</p>

<p>My train arrived a minute before
it was scheduled to leave.
A kid stepped up to the conductor.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 267px;">
<a href="images/i071large.jpg"><img src="images/i071.jpg" width="267" height="364" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Say, mister, there are two
men on this train who came all
the way from New York, and
didn't pay any fare."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>The conductor thought that some fellows were
beating the company and went through the whole
train, but couldn't find any one who didn't have his
proper ticket.</p>

<p>So, seeing the kid, he says:</p>

<p>"Hey, where are the two men?"</p>

<p>"On the engine. The engineer and fireman,"
shrieked the kid.</p>

<p>After the train got in motion, I suddenly espied my
old friend Joe Dempsey, who is an insurance agent.</p>

<p>"Hello, Joe," says I, "why so glum?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see, Walter," says he, "I proposed to
old Billion's daughter and she refused to have me."</p>

<p>"Well," says I, "that's nothing. There are other
girls."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," says he, "but I can't help feeling
sorry for the poor girl."</p>

<p>I looked around for something to throw.</p>

<p>"Yes," he continued, "especially after the beautiful
dream I had about her the other night. I dreamt
that I had married her and that she had settled
$14,000,000 on me."</p>

<p>"Yes, and then you woke up," says I.</p>

<p>"No," says he, "that's the funny part of it. I put
that money in the bank."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, that's all right," says I, "but you'll have a
dickens of a time in getting it out again."</p>

<p>"That's easy," says he, "I'll just go to sleep again.
I guess I'll do that now and draw some of the
interest."</p>

<p>We got to the city of the dead and, having nothing
else to do, I went with Joe on a scout for business.</p>

<p>While we were out in the
suburbs, he struck a man
putting up some kind of a
building, for he had a large
pile of bricks.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, neighbor,"
says Joe. "I'd like to insure
this new cottage you are
putting up."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 310px;">
<a href="images/i072large.jpg"><img src="images/i072.jpg" width="310" height="339" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"It isn't a cottage at all," began the man.</p>

<p>"Ah, well, my good man," says Joe, "if it's only a
dog-house, you'd better have it insured."</p>

<p>"Confound you," says the suburbanite, now in a
rage, "get out of this. I'm rebuilding my well."</p>

<p>Joe, soon after this, decided to stay in the carpetbaggers'
city and take the agency of a large insurance
company.</p>

<p>One day there was a very destructive fire at
Cohen &amp; Wosislosmitdewhiskey's clothing store.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>Joe took the company's adjuster and went down
to investigate.</p>

<p>A good deal of discussion resulted, in which the
cause of the fire figured principally.</p>

<p>Cohen said it was due to the electric wiring, and
his partner claimed it was the gas-light.</p>

<p>Finally the adjuster called upon Joe to render his
opinion.</p>

<p>"Look here, Joe," says he. "This man claims it
was the Arc-light and this fellow that it was the
Gas-light. Now what do
you think it was?"</p>

<p>"Well," says Joe, "if you
want my candid opinion, I
think it was neither. I'll bet
a dollar that it was the
Israelite."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 316px;">
<a href="images/i073large.jpg"><img src="images/i073.jpg" width="316" height="269" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Joe at last got married and, when his son was still
quite young, it bothered him somewhat to know just
what trade or profession he ought to select for him.</p>

<p>So at last he told his wife to get the boy a box
of paints, a toy steam engine, a printing press, and
see what the boy would take to most readily.</p>

<p>When Joe got home at night, he asked his wife
how the plan had succeeded.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm a bit puzzled," says she, "he has
smashed the whole lot to atoms."</p>

<p>"The very thing," says Joe.
"We'll make him a furniture
mover."</p>

<p>That didn't suit Mrs. Dempsey
though, and she said they
ought to have the boy a musician.</p>

<p>"All right," says Joe, "we'll let him learn the
clarionette."</p>

<p>"Why, Joe!" says his wife. "Whoever heard of
such a thing. I say, let him learn to play the violin.
Think what an unhandy thing a clarionette is to
carry."</p>

<p>"That's right, my dear," says Joe, "but think what
a darn handy thing it is in case of a scrap."</p>

<p>Now I'll try to amuse you by singing my latest dead
march, entitled "The Moth and the Flame; or, My
Kingdom For a Fire."</p>

<p>That song always gives my friend Rosensky a bad
attack of indigestion.</p>

<p>All the time I'm singing it he keeps moaning:</p>

<p>"Dink if that vas me. Dink!"</p>

<p>The time I was boarding, my landlady's name was
Mrs. Closefist.</p>

<p>One day she went to the grocery store and says:</p>

<p>"I'd like to have some more of that bad butter
you sold me last week."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why," says the grocer, "if it was bad, what do
you want more for?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see," says she, "it lasts longer."</p>

<p>This same woman had a calf.
That calf was taken sick and
died. We had veal for the next
three weeks.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 256px;">
<a href="images/i076large.jpg"><img src="images/i076.jpg" width="256" height="442" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>She had a pig and that pig
died. We had pork for the next
four weeks.</p>

<p>She had a mother-in-law. That
mother-in-law was taken sick&mdash;but
we fooled her, we all moved.</p>

<p>One morning my egg wasn't fried right, so I blew
the girl up.</p>

<p>She blew the servant up, the servant blew the cook
up, and the gasoline stove blew the frying pan up.</p>

<p>It was a case of blow-up all around.</p>

<p>Mrs. Closefist had a daughter named Jane, who
was taking painting lessons at the time.</p>

<p>She also took pains to let every one within a
hundred miles know about it.</p>

<p>One day she brought down a thing that looked to
me like a green shutter in a cloud of steam.</p>

<p>"Look here," says she, "isn't this pretty?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 273px;">
<a href="images/i077large.jpg"><img src="images/i077.jpg" width="273" height="318" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"I'm enraptured," says I.
"Such a wealth of detail, such
a display of budding genius!
The perspective is simply perfect.
It-it-it&mdash;is&mdash;so&mdash;clever.
Oh! confound it, I can't find
words to express my admiration.
By the way, what is it?"</p>

<p>"Why," says she, "I am surprised. It represents
a green field on a cloudy day. Can't I paint well?"</p>

<p>"Fine," says I. "In fact you have done so well, I
am going to recommend you to a friend of mine who
wants a fence whitewashed."</p>

<p>Mrs. Closefist, whose reputation for meanness
was well known, was in the habit of giving a soiree
once a year, "just to liven the boarders up."</p>

<p>I don't know whether it made any of the other
fellows particularly lively, but I know that on such
occasions was the only time I ever managed to get
any sleep.</p>

<p>There were very few outsiders who attended, because
the "racket" usually partook very much of the
chief trait of the hostess.</p>

<p>Once, when she was making preparations for one
of these soul-stirring affairs, she says to me:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'd like to give my guests a pleasant surprise.
Something distinctly original."</p>

<p>I thought a moment and then says:</p>

<p>"Madam, countermand the invitations."</p>

<p>That woman was the meanest thing in the form of
a human being I ever struck.</p>

<p>No, I'm wrong; for meanness I give the palm to a
certain car driver.</p>

<p>Once, when I was a kid, I footed it out to a
resort near my home.</p>

<p>The only cars that ran out there were those little
"jiggers."</p>

<p>Well, I was pretty tired when I got out, and didn't
feel like walking back.</p>

<p>So I asked one of the drivers to let me hitch
behind.</p>

<p>"Where's your fare?" says he.</p>

<p>"Ain't got none," says I.</p>

<p>"Then you can't ride," says he.
"But look here, I'll tell you what
I'll do. Take those buckets and
go to that well up the road, and
water that horse and I'll let you ride free."</p>

<p>And he pointed to a skinny-looking
little horse.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 280px;">
<a href="images/i078large.jpg"><img src="images/i078.jpg" width="280" height="306" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>I got two buckets and the horse drank them off
quick as a wink. I got four, I got six, I got ten, a
dozen, always with the same result.</p>

<p>Finally the fellow who owned the well refused to
let me have any more water, and I went back and
told the driver that the man who leased the Great
Lakes from St. Peter had locked them up and gone
to bed.</p>

<p>"Well," says he, "you didn't fill your contract and
I can't let you ride."</p>

<p>As I was going away, a fellow stepped up to me
and says:</p>

<p>"You darn fool, they brought all the horses in the
stable out and you've watered them one by one."</p>

<p>Say, I don't think I ever told
you of the time I went to England.
You see, I arrived at
Liverpool and took the train for
London.</p>

<p>The train seemed to me to be
going remarkably fast for that
country and I got sort of uneasy.</p>

<p>At the first stop, I went to
the guard and said:</p>

<p>"Say, this is pretty fast traveling, isn't it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, no, you needn't be alarmed, we never run off
the line here."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's not that I'm afraid of," says I. "I'm
afraid you'll run off your blamed little island."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 274px;">
<a href="images/i080large.jpg"><img src="images/i080.jpg" width="274" height="278" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>While out for a stroll the other afternoon, I
reached the foot of a steep hill just in time to see a
fellow with an automobile come skating down faster
than he intended.</p>

<p>When he had reached the bottom and the dust
had settled, I walked over and asked him if he was
hurt.</p>

<p>He said he wasn't, but looked
ruefully at his auto.</p>

<p>"This darned thing cost a
cool two thousand the other
day, but I'd be willing to sell it
for fifty now," says he.</p>

<p>I looked it over and it seemed a pretty likely sort
of machine and not very much hurt, so I took
him up.</p>

<p>He got out of the way mighty quick, and three
minutes after he disappeared two mounted policemen
came dashing up.</p>

<p>"Ha!" says one of them, "we've got you. Come
right along."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>Do you know, I had a deuce of a time in convincing
them that it was not I who had stolen the
machine?</p>

<p>I went to a real old-fashioned wake the other
night.</p>

<p>It was the most entertaining innovation I ever
attended.</p>

<p>I got there pretty late and all the beer had flown
down where the Wurzburger usually flows.</p>

<p>I sat down beside my old friend, McGarrigan.</p>

<p>"What, Mac, you one of the mourners, too?"</p>

<p>"Whoi not?" says he. "Didn't the corpse owe me
ten dollars?"</p>

<p>"Well," says I, "cheer up."</p>

<p>"I can't," says he, "the beer is all gone."</p>

<p>Just then I saw his face
brighten up.</p>

<p>I followed the direction of
his glance and saw it rested on
a gallon jug.</p>

<p>Mac got up quietly and took
the jug into the hallway.</p>

<p>He came back in ten seconds looking more mournful
than ever.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Mac," says I, "was the jug
empty?"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 279px;">
<a href="images/i081large.jpg"><img src="images/i081.jpg" width="279" height="272" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," says he.</p>

<p>"Wasn't the wine good?" says I.</p>

<p>"It wasn't wine," says he.</p>

<p>"What was in the jug, Mac?" says I.</p>

<p>He gave me a sheepish, sidelong glance and says:</p>

<p>"Water."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 277px;">
<a href="images/i082large.jpg"><img src="images/i082.jpg" width="277" height="343" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Mac is a boss carpenter.</p>

<p>The other day he called his
assistant and says:</p>

<p>"Here, Jim, I'm going out for
a few minutes and you can plane
down this beam until I return."</p>

<p>He pointed to a big beam
about eighteen inches square.</p>

<p>But, alas! when poor Mac got out on the street,
he slipped and sprained his ankle.</p>

<p>They took him home and it was the next day,
toward evening, before he could hobble around to
his shop.</p>

<p>His assistant was nowhere in sight.</p>

<p>The only thing that met his gaze, was an enormous
pile of shavings.</p>

<p>So he bawled out:</p>

<p>"James!"</p>

<p>"Hello," came the far off response.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where are you?" says Mac.</p>

<p>"Here under this pile of shavings," says Jim.</p>

<p>"What are you up to, anyway?" says Mac.</p>

<p>"Planing that beam. You told me to plane it until
you came back. If you had come an hour later
there wouldn't have been anything left of it."</p>

<p>Poor Mac sprained his ankle again.</p>

<p>Say, did you ever go to a dime museum?</p>

<p>If not you want to take it in by all means. It's a
sure cure for glanders.</p>

<p>I went to one last week, and had more fun than
if I came here and listened to these dispensers of
heavenly harmony.</p>

<p>Say, wasn't that last part fine? I'm coming up,
I am!</p>

<p>I hope to be in the same class as Chuck Conners
some day.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 265px;">
<a href="images/i083large.jpg"><img src="images/i083.jpg" width="265" height="357" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Well, as I said, I went to
this shelter for freaks and
looked them over.</p>

<p>There was the fat lady who
was blown up twice a day with
the air pump.</p>

<p>A kid in front of me stuck a
pin in her arm and punctured her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 264px;">
<a href="images/i084large.jpg"><img src="images/i084.jpg" width="264" height="271" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>There was the living skeleton
who was fed on pork and beans
three times a day.</p>

<p>There was the Circassian girl
who paid twelve dollars for her
wig.</p>

<p>When we got to the glass eater, the real fun began.</p>

<p>There was a yap and his wife standing where they
could get a good view of the performance.</p>

<p>They watched him, enraptured for a time, and
finally the woman says:</p>

<p>"Hiram, just look at that fellow eating window
glass."</p>

<p>"That's nothing," says Hiram, "our little Reuben can
do the same thing."</p>

<p>"G'wan," says the woman, "how's that?"</p>

<p>"Why, if he eats little green apples, won't he have
pains on the inside?"</p>

<p>Then we passed on to the ventriloquist.</p>

<p>"What's a ventriloquist, Hiram?" says Mandy.</p>

<p>"Why," says Hiram, "it's a fellow what stands on
one side of the room and talks to hisself from the
other."</p>

<p>But the climax came when we got to the wonderful
wax figure, recently imported from Paris at the
unheard of price of ten thousand dollars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 270px;">
<a href="images/i085large.jpg"><img src="images/i085.jpg" width="270" height="449" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>I looked that wax figure over and something about
it struck me as being familiar.</p>

<p>Finally it came to me all at
once.</p>

<p>It was Sim Johnson, who borrowed
twenty dollars from me
out in Chicago. So I went over.</p>

<p>"Hello, Sim," says I. He
never moved a muscle.</p>

<p>"Don't you know me, Sim?"
says I.</p>

<p>"Go 'way," says he, without
moving his lips.</p>

<p>That made me mad as a hornet, and I says:</p>

<p>"Go 'way? Not much. Who is the wall-eyed,
bandy-legged, beer-guzzling harp, who borrowed
twenty dollars from me, out in Chicago?"</p>

<p>He never said a word. That got me madder.</p>

<p>I continued to pay my respects in this fashion:</p>

<p>"You miserable, consumptive-looking ingrate. You
sea-sick-looking, despicable turkey hen; I'd like to
kill you. You mean to rob me."</p>

<p>"You lie," shrieked Sim, now warmed up.</p>

<p>Then I had to run. He caught up a big glass
case of butterflies and heaved it in my direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>But the way the butterflies flew wasn't a patch
to the way I flew when the porters got hold of me.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 259px;">
<a href="images/i086large.jpg"><img src="images/i086.jpg" width="259" height="356" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Talking of wax men, puts me in mind of a fellow
who lives in the flat opposite mine.</p>

<p>He's about the most miserable specimen of a
man I ever struck.</p>

<p>His wife is always quarreling
with him; he's always quarreling
with his wife.</p>

<p>When he proposed to her he
said, as we all have said:</p>

<p>"Darling, if you will only marry
me, I will make you the best
husband in the world."</p>

<p>"Never fear, sweet," says she, "if I marry you, I'll
make you that all right, all right."</p>

<p>One afternoon, I heard her giving him a Sam Hill
of a blow-up and met him in the hall soon afterward.</p>

<p>"Say," says I, "why in thunder don't you assert
your independence?"</p>

<p>"Independence," he wailed, "why she won't even
grant me home rule."</p>

<p>"What were you scrapping about just now?" says I.</p>

<p>"Well, you see," says he, "when I married her I
told her I delighted in cleanliness. When I got home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
to-day, she told me she had just paid a dollar to
have the coal bin scrubbed out and we expect a load
of coal to-morrow. Then, too, she told me she had
bought a dream of a hat at a
bargain, and I asked her
whether there ever was a
time she didn't get a bargain,
and she says: 'Yes, when I
married you.'"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 317px;">
<a href="images/i087large.jpg"><img src="images/i087.jpg" width="317" height="388" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Well, late that night the
unhappy couple got to scrapping
again, and the worm
turned and gave his wife a most unmerciful beating.</p>

<p>I thought he was going to kill her, so I went in
search of a policeman.</p>

<p>I looked around for about an hour and finally
located one talking to Billyon's cook.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 303px;">
<a href="images/i088large.jpg"><img src="images/i088.jpg" width="303" height="317" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Say," says I, "you're
wanted around the corner.
A man has nearly killed his
wife."</p>

<p>"How big is the man?"
says he.</p>

<p>"Oh, he's bigger than
you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," says he, "I'm sorry, old man, but it's off my
beat."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 286px;">
<a href="images/i089large.jpg"><img src="images/i089.jpg" width="286" height="364" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>I went to the race track the other day and met a
bookmaker I know.</p>

<p>"Hello," says he. "What brings you here? Do
you know anything?"</p>

<p>"No," says I, "if I did, I
wouldn't be here."</p>

<p>I finally placed a small bet
on a couple of horses, and
when the first race was run off,
anxiously watched the ponies.</p>

<p>They soon got so far away
that I couldn't keep track of
them, and noticing a fellow
with a pair of field glasses
next to me, who seemed to be seeing everything
going on, I says:</p>

<p>"How does Sunflower stand?"</p>

<p>Sunflower was the horse I bet on, you know.</p>

<p>"I don't know," says he, "I'm only watching the
first ten horses."</p>

<p>Just to liven things up a bit, I'll sing you a song
entitled "Music On The Installment Plan; or, How
Would You Like To Be The Piano Man?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I love thee, ah, yes, I love thee,"<br /></span>

<p>I don't know whether to laugh or cry when I sing
that song, but I guess I'll laugh.</p>

<p>Crying doesn't suit my complexion; then, too, I've
enough to be sad about already.</p>

<p>I live in the suburbs.</p>

<p>You see if a man lives in the city, his wife always
wants to go to some show or other, and that costs
money.</p>

<p>We have a fine lot of neighbors out our way, I can
tell you. They're so friendly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>The other day the woman next door stepped in, as
I was coming to New York, and wanted to know if
I wouldn't stop at Cooper &amp; Siegel's and get her
goods for a dress. I promised I would.</p>

<p>When I got there, I found an old maid ahead of me.</p>

<p>The shop-girl had evidently taken down almost
every roll of cloth in the place, but as each new one
was unfolded, the old maid would say:</p>

<p>"No, no, I don't think that would do."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 258px;">
<a href="images/i091large.jpg"><img src="images/i091.jpg" width="258" height="405" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>All the rolls had been exhibited
except one, when the
old maid says:</p>

<p>"Never mind taking that down,
I won't buy any cloth to-day. I
was only looking for a friend."</p>

<p>"But, madam," says the girl,
"if you think there's any possibility
of her being in this roll, I'll
open it up."</p>

<p>Just as I was about to say that I wanted some
kind of cloth that would suit a red-headed woman, a
little dapper chap butted in and says to the girl:</p>

<p>"Ah, darling Louisa, I have thought of you all
week. How I love you dear. Will you give me
your heart?"</p>

<p>I was just drawing back my foot to give him a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
number eight where it would wake him up, when the
girl says:</p>

<p>"Certainly, dearest Harold. Cash! Cash!! Cash!!!
Where will you have it sent?"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 263px;">
<a href="images/i092large.jpg"><img src="images/i092.jpg" width="263" height="468" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>I was just about to say what
I wanted, when another tall,
lanky, moth-eaten-looking fellow
stepped in and engaged the
girl's attention for half an hour.</p>

<p>Finally he turned and went
out without buying anything.</p>

<p>The floorwalker stepped up
to the girl and says:</p>

<p>"You let that man go out
without buying anything."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"He was at your counter for a half hour."</p>

<p>"I know it," says the girl.</p>

<p>"In spite of all the questions he asked, you rarely
answered him."</p>

<p>"I know it," says the girl, "but then, you see, I
didn't have what he wanted."</p>

<p>"And what's that?" asked the floorwalker.</p>

<p>"Five dollars. He wanted me to subscribe to a
life of Mark Hanna, compiled by a workingman."</p>

<p>I finally got what I wanted and left the store.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a very pleasant day and I thought I'd take
a short walk.</p>

<p>I came to a large building in the course of construction.
Just outside was a crowd of workingmen
who had some argument.</p>

<p>I crossed over to see what was the matter and
found two men pummeling each other unmercifully.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 272px;">
<a href="images/i093large.jpg"><img src="images/i093.jpg" width="272" height="256" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Finally the one who was getting
the worst of it cried out:</p>

<p>"Say, I thought this was to
be a fair, stand-up fight?"</p>

<p>"That's right," said a number
of his companions.</p>

<p>"Well, how the devil can it be a fair, stand-up
fight if he keeps knocking me down all the time?"</p>

<p>All at once a cop put in an appearance and arrested
the principals, and some of the bystanders as
witnesses.</p>

<p>I thought I would see the thing out, so I went to
court where one of the men entered the
charge of assault against the
other.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 320px;">
<a href="images/i094large.jpg"><img src="images/i094.jpg" width="320" height="311" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>The whole crowd wanted
to explain, but they only succeeded
in getting the judge
sadly mixed up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>He told them to be quiet and addressed himself
to one of the witnesses.</p>

<p>"Now, look here," he says. "As the court understands
it, the defendant here began the quarrel, because
the plaintiff hurled a vile epithet
at him. Was that the way of it?"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 255px;">
<a href="images/i095large.jpg"><img src="images/i095.jpg" width="255" height="393" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"No, your honor," says the man.
"Nobody chucked an epithet.
Mike called John a bad name and
John heaved a brick at him. Nobody
hurled nothing else."</p>

<p>After leaving court one of my
teeth pained me dreadfully, so I
went to the dentist to have it attended to.</p>

<p>He advised me to take gas.</p>

<p>"All right," says I. "What is the effect of gas?"</p>

<p>"Why," says he, "it simply makes you totally insensible.
You don't know anything that's taking
place."</p>

<p>"Go ahead," says I, and I put my hand in my
pocket and pulled out all the money I had.</p>

<p>The dentist, thinking that I was about to pay him,
says:</p>

<p>"Oh, don't bother about that now. You have plenty
of time."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's all right," says I. "I just wanted to see
how much money I had before the gas took effect."</p>

<p>I took a walk up Broadway the other night and
ran into my old friend Jenkins.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 287px;">
<a href="images/i096large.jpg"><img src="images/i096.jpg" width="287" height="350" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>After numerous liquid greetings,
I asked him how Mrs.
Jenkins was.</p>

<p>"Well," says he, "she isn't
well at all. You see, she had
an awful experience last night.</p>

<p>"I was out and she was all
alone in the house. Suddenly
she heard muffled footsteps on the porch. They
came nearer and finally sounded in the dining-room.</p>

<p>"Bravely she faced the midnight marauder, who
pointed a pistol at her head.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 310px;">
<a href="images/i097large.jpg"><img src="images/i097.jpg" width="310" height="357" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"'Tell me where the money is hid,' he hissed, 'or
I'll fire.'</p>

<p>"'Never,' she answered determinedly.
'Villain, do your
worst.'</p>

<p>"'I will,' snarled the scoundrel,
baffled but not beaten.
'Tell me instantly where that
money is hid, or I'll drop this
big woolly caterpillar down your neck.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>"Two minutes later that darned burglar crept out
of the house with my hard-earned money. I tell you,
Jones, he was a genius."</p>

<p>I left Jenkins.</p>

<p>I had walked only a block when I met old Bilgewater,
an English sea captain.</p>

<p>He was delighted to see me and insisted that I
take luncheon with him.</p>

<p>We went to a nearby restaurant and sat down
at a table near the door.</p>

<p>I noticed as old Bilgewater sat down, he did it
very stiffly. He didn't act as though he was at all
comfortable.</p>

<p>Pretty soon he reached into his hip pocket and
brought out a large telescope.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 334px;">
<a href="images/i098large.jpg"><img src="images/i098.jpg" width="334" height="394" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"That's a pretty hefty thing to sit on, ain't it?"
says he, by way of introduction.</p>

<p>I said it was.</p>

<p>"Well, I never let that
'scope out of my sight,"
says he.</p>

<p>"Why?" says I. "Valuable?"</p>

<p>"Yes," says he, "werry. It were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
given me by my old friend Nelson,
in return for services rendered
in licking the French."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 282px;">
<a href="images/i099large.jpg"><img src="images/i099.jpg" width="282" height="458" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Why, man," says I, astounded
at the barefaced lie, "Nelson
has been dead for over a hundred
years!"</p>

<p>"Well, well," says he, "so he
has. How time does fly."</p>

<p>I think it's almost time I
warbled something. How's this?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She was a maid of high degree,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To her came wooing, suitors three,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">"I'll take and make him somebody."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So they were married, he and she,<br /></span>

<p>Now, considering that I've got to do some hundred-yard
dashes up and down a twenty-foot flat
with my youngest son, I think I'll say good-night.</p>

<p>May your slumbers be more peaceful than mine.</p>
